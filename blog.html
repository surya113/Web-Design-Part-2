<h2>Community and Live Music - Blog</h2>
<p>Live performance is vital to the music sector, both in reaching audiences and generating income. According to Live Performance Australia, over nine million tickets are sold annually to live music and music theatre performances in Australia, with an industry output of over $1.5 billion. This makes our live performance industry larger than the film, television and video games sector. Studies into the venue based live music industry (predominantly clubs and pubs) have found this sector injects $1.2 billion annually into the Australian economy. It also supports close to 15,000 jobs. <br><br>

Despite this, many pressures impact on live music including gentrification, poker machines and rising costs. A National Live Music Office has been established to boost live music across the country and many cities are developing live music strategies.</p><br>

<p>Music is a key contributor to Australiaâ€™s copyright industries which employ 8% of our workforce, generate economic value of over $ 93 billion and contribute over $7 billion in exports, according to a report prepared by pwc for the Copyright Council. The impacts of the digital age on many copyright industries including music, books and newspapers, has seen negative growth in recent years with a seven percent drop from 1997 to 2011 in Australia. This provides a powerful reason to build new and effective distribution methods supported by solid policy frameworks and industry action.</p><br>
<p>Australian music benefits from both public and private investment and derives considerable revenues from earned income. Ticket sales comprise half the income of the Live Performance Industry and Government funding 18 % (Live Performance Australia). National and state funding bodies, and some local governments, provide operational and project support; commercial companies invest in popular artists and activities; support is also provided through sponsorship and philanthropy, and innovations such as crowd funding are introducing new and responsive ways to raise music funding.
