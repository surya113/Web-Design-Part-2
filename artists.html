		<p>The alternative celtic rock band from North Queensland

Typical audience response: - "WOW - I wasn't prepared for that! Racing around the stage in kilts, blowing bagpipes, jumping from one instrument to the next, these guys know how to entertain!" 

They will break your heart with the mournful and eerie sounds of the Great Highland Bagpipe and then crank it up real hard and rock you 'til you drop. 

This 11 piece band is a fun-loving kick-em-in-the-pants band that just wants to rock - celtic style!

		<p>The Camerata Singers
 Poms from Oz 
The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dallâ€™Osto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotterâ€™s Markets in the mall. 

The Camerata Singers comprises a group of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions. For further information or bookings contact the Music Centre 4724 2086

		<p>Poms from Oz
 Poms from Oz 
Poms from Oz are Judy, Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy, a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland, Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendents of First Fleeters. 

Their tight harmony and vocal strength bring a fresh feel to original, contemporary and traditional works, uncovering a rich tapestry of songs gathered in their travels from around the world. Most songs are a cappella but sometimes accompanied by guitar and/or harmonica. Moods in their songs range from downright to real tear jerkers and audience participation is encouraged. Their sound is distinctive, as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices.
