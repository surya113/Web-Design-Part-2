			<p><b>Posted 24-Mar-15 </b>Chord Organ Volunteer Singers / Musicians</p>
			<p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. <br><br>

			I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform. <br>
			Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music. <br>
			I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. 
			Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7. <br><br>

			If you would like to take part, please call Merle Trembath 0418882633 anytime</p>
